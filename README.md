# My Bookshelf Project
----------------------

This is an awesome demo project (Angular) to show how a bookshelf might work.
The angular app is just to demonstrate the bookshelf.js js class usage.

NOTE: This project does not follow best practices of Angular as its primary objective was to 
demonstrate the bookshelf.js class.


## Installation

### Installing the Angular dependencies
bower install

### Installing a simple http server to load the app
npm install -g http-server

### Start the http server
http-server app/ -g -o
